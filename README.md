# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpected Style Override

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in CSS related to selector specificity and the cascade.  A more specific selector fails to override a less specific one due to the order of declarations and how the browser processes CSS rules.

## Bug Description

The provided CSS code includes selectors with varying specificity.  It's expected that a more specific selector (e.g., `.container #myElement`) will override a less specific one (e.g., `#myElement`), but this doesn't always happen as expected depending on the cascade.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` and `bugSolution.css`.
3.  Observe the unexpected styling in `bug.css` and compare it to the correct styling in `bugSolution.css`.

## Solution

The solution involves understanding and addressing CSS specificity. The correct way to ensure that a more specific selector takes precedence is to either place the more specific rule after the less specific one in your CSS file or to use the `!important` flag (though use of `!important` is generally discouraged as it can make your code less maintainable).
