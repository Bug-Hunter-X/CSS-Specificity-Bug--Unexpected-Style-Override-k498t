The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error where a seemingly correct selector doesn't apply styles as expected due to the specificity of selectors and the cascade.

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#myElement {
  width: 200px;
  background-color: lightgreen; 
}

.container #myElement {
  width: 300px; /* This style is intended to override the #myElement styles */
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

The expectation is that `#myElement` inside `.container` should have a width of 300px and a yellow background. However, due to the order of CSS declarations and selector specificity, the `#myElement` selector might override the `.container #myElement` selector, resulting in a width of 200px and a lightgreen background.
